# Contact Management System Documentation

# Overview

This project implements a simple contact management system using SQLite as the backend database. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding new contacts, deleting contacts, updating contact information, and checking if a contact exists by name ,all done with dictionary in python. This system is designed to be simple and make use of command line as UI.


# Database Setup

ðŸ‘‰name: The contact's name (Primary Key)

ðŸ‘‰phone_number: The contact's phone number

PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVNT IMPLEMENTED THIS WITH A REAL WEB BASED UI OR AN APP BECAUSE I FOCUS ON MAKING ANY PROJECT DONE BY ME COMMAND LINE FOR TESTING PURPOSE AT FIRST.I KNOW COMMAND LIKE IS KINDA OLD FASHIONED BUT IT GIVES ALL POSIBLE OPERATIONS AS SAME AS DONE IN A WEB OR APP.THANKYOU FOR YOUR TIME HAVE A GOOD DAY.
